# RubyTestExecutor
The RubyTestExeuctor is a mechanism to integrate Ruby and/or Watir scripted tests into the NUnit testing framework so tests can be run with a single test runner and results can be automatically aggregated.

This project was [originally released as part of a CodeProject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12696/Integrated-ASP-NET-Web-Application-Testing-with-NU) which I also [blogged](http://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2006/01/13/paraesthesia.test.ruby-integrating-nunit-with-rubywatir-unit-tests.aspx/).
